                                                                     ONLINE CROWDFUNDING PLATFORM
                                                                    
1) Background/ Problem Statement

Crowdfunding is an online money-raising strategy that began as a way for the public to donate small amounts of money to help  creative people finance their projects. Through 
crowdfunding, individuals are able to invest in entrepreneurial start-ups using an intermediary agency like a broker or dealer. The problem with crowdfunding currently 
is that it is not easy for early-stage start-ups to get in touch with investors and secure funding. The entrepreneurs do not have the required contacts or a way to 
convince investors and experts to join them and help grow their business. Due to this, an idea that could be the next Paytm,Zomato or Lenskart gets lost in the wayside.
Our platform will provide a safe, secure and transparent way for crowdfunding. It will not only help entrepreneurs to get feedback and funding, but also help in making
the best reviewed ideas easily visible to the investors.

2) Working of the Project

Our website will have three main types of users – investors (can registers as individuals or as an organisation) , entrepreneurs , and experts . Experts are certified 
individuals who have held major positions in the past and have major experience in development.Entrepreneurs will post the details of their idea , potential funding 
requirement , scope of the project, and what it could potentially become. Experts will then rate these ideas based on various important metrics like scalability, market 
space, level of innovation, and potential profitability.Investors can sort the ideas based on categories like top rated, most funded and potential dark horses 
(identified by experts). If an investor is interested in a project, they can request for entrepreneurs for contact details. If an invested is made by the investor in 
a particular project then the website will verify the transaction and update the project details .

3) Advantages
